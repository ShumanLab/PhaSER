# Recording Details

- **Probe:** Cambridge Neurotech Acute H3, 64 channels  
- **Sampling rate:** 25 kHz



# PhaSER Baseline Training Data
- **File Name:** PhaSERtrainingData.txt
- **Duration:** 2 minutes at 25 kHz  
- **Source:** First 2 minutes of the recording  
- **Note:** The baseline period in this sample may differ from the one used during the on-line recording.



# PhaSER Testing Data

Testing is split into two segments:

### Trough-targeted stimulation
- **File Name:** PhaSERtestingData_Phase170.txt
- **Phase:** 170  
- **Duration:** ~6 minutes  

### Peak-targeted stimulation
- **File Name:** PhaSERtestingData_Phase0.txt
- **Phase:** 0  
- **Duration:** ~4.5 minutes



# PhaSER Expected Outcome
The dataset includes the actual online TTL trigger events delivered during the Phase 170 and Phase 0 testing periods, respectively.
